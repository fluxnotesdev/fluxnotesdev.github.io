# Ideas for features:

Target Audience: Programmers / Note takers

Core Features: notes + runnable code database + productivity features (calendar, task manager, etc.)

## Detailed ideas:

- Inline code blocks (not runnable), for short snippets like a single for loop or something
- Runnable code blocks, link to separate code file that is runnable, and have it show up in a block.
- Feature to share task with other / collaborate on task and maybe also notes.

### Definitions
- Definitions can be added inline (like a callout) (together with Theorems, lemmata, corrolaries etc.)
- When we create a definition the editor automatically extracts the "title" and creates a card / page that can be linked to. When we mention the word(s) in another note the editor suggests linking to the definition.





## Things to consider:

- Have a folder with all the notes (similar to how Obsidian does it), OR keep the file explorer of the system (might be messy since most of our files will be markdown)
